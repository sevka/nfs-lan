{"name":"Nfs-lan","tagline":"NFS (Network File System) support in Nautilus (Gnome default file manager)","body":"NFS-LAN\r\n=======\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\nNFS-LAN - plugin for Nautilus file manager (GNOME environment default file manager), that allows to share and browse NFS network (NFS - Network File System). \r\nIt's missing functionality in Gnome.\r\n\r\nThere are two branches exist now. \r\n\r\n * 1.x - for Gnome3/Nautilus3 (Ubuntu 12.04 for example)\r\n * 0.x - for Gnome2/Nautilus2 (Ubuntu 10.04 for example)\r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\n-----------------\r\nIt based on such technologies and packages :\r\n\r\n * Python. All code written on Python.\r\n * python-gtk for GUI \r\n * python-nautilus for Nautilus python plugin\r\n * nfs-client and nfs-server for NFS support\r\n * autofs for auto mounting\r\n * avahi-browse (avahi-utils) and avahi-daemon for computers' list\r\n * showmount - to get only computers with shares\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nJust install *.deb package. Autofs package is in the dependecies, but you have to configure it by yourself, if you want to browse NFS shares automatically. \r\nPlease edit /etc/auto.master and uncomment this line:\r\n\r\n    /net -hosts\r\n\r\nYou can add --timeout parameter (in this case you have a problems with unmounting shares which going down):\r\n\r\n    /net -hosts --timeout=60\r\n\r\nThen restart autofs:\r\n\r\n    sudo service autofs restart\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n###NFS sharing\r\nTo share folder in Nautilus, just right-click on folder and choose \"Share this folder through NFS...\". Then setup sharing options and click Ok.\r\n\r\n**Behind the scene**: NFS-LAN modify /etc/exports file and restarts NFS server\r\n\r\n###NFS browsing\r\nGo to /net folder in Nautilus. When you open /net folder first time in the session, NFS-LAN do `Refresh` action. \r\nNFS-LAN search for remote computers with avahi daemon activated (in Ubuntu avahi daemon activated by default). If your remote PC doesn't have avavi you can:\r\n\r\n  * use `Computer name or ip` area\r\n  * or just go to URI: /net/your_computer_name_or_ip\r\n  \r\n**Behind the scene**. When you first time open /net folder or press Refresh button in the top panel, NFS-LAN search for remote PCs\r\nwith avahi-daemon activated, then search for shares on these PCs. And then just do command 'cd /net/computer_name'.\r\nAutofs do the rest.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
